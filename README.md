========================
This is a practice project provided by Coursera for Djnago developer practice.

## Objectives required by team: 

The team wants you to implement a web-based user registration, authentication, and authorization and integrate these functionalities within Lushlyrics's existing website. Below is a summary of the required website features:

- Users should be able to create accounts easily and conveniently. The team wants users to have access to attractive and convenient registration process. The team is flexible about the design of the user experience and aesthetics you use in designing the relevant forms.

- The team does not have specific requirements on implementing user verification as a part of the registration process. However, you can include phone or email verification, both of them, or none of them.

- Users should be able to log in and out of the system conveniently. You can be creative here about designing the user experience and the aesthetics of the relevant forms.

- The team does not have specific requirement on incorporating two-factors authentication as a part of the login process. You may choose to skip this feature or implement it using SMS or email. 

- Users should be able to recover their accounts if they lose their credentials. The team is flexible about the way you choose to implement this. You can use email-based or phone-based recovery workflow.

After implementing these changes, users will not have access to Lushlyrics's website until they register and login to the system. Users should be able to easily and conveniently create their accounts and login and out of the website. They should also be able to recover their accounts if they lose their credentials.
